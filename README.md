## Ecommerce Example App

This is a web application that demonstrates an ecommerce website with a list of products on the home page, and allows users to add products to their cart and favorites list. The app also includes a navigation bar with two pages to view the cart and favorited products, with the ability to cancel the operation at those pages. The state is managed with the useState hook and shared between pages using the context provider.

### Features

-   Display a list of products on the home page
-   Add products to cart and favorites list
-   View cart and favorites list on separate pages
-   Ability to cancel the operation at cart and favorites list pages
-   State management with useState and context provider

### Technologies used

-   React JS

### Why I created this project

I built this project to practice my skills in React JS, specifically with state management and context provider. Ecommerce websites are a great way to learn how to manage state in a complex application, and sharing state between pages can be a challenging but rewarding experience.
